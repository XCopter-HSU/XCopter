How-To: charging Batteries for the X-Copter

Info: This little tutorial describes how to charge our batteries for the X-Copter-Project

Our Hardware: 	Battery1 (LiPo_01): FlightPower Hacker evo 20 4900mAh 6S1P
									charging: continuous: 20C, burst: 50C, charging: 1C
									Stored in: Speicher[31] as LiPo_01
				Battery2 (LiPo_02): XTRON 40C 5000mAh 6S1P
									continuous: 40C, burst: 80C, charging: 4C
//ToDo								Stored in: Speicher[31] as LiPo_02
				Battery3 (NiCd_01): loading current: 110mAh
				Charging-Station:	Ultra Duo Plus 60
									Stored in: Speicher[19] as NiCa_01

We saved three configurations in the Ultra Duo for our batteries named: Lipo_01, Lipo_02 and NiCd_01

Important: Warnings and security information are found in the documentantion-pdf:
6478_ULTRA DUO PLUS 60_de.pdf
You should read that before using the charging station as the information therein will not be
in this tutorial

Charging Batteries:
Current charged per charging session = current * charging time
Refer to the datasheet of your batteries for information about max. current for charging.
Standard-charging-current is 1/10 of the capacity (1,7Ah capacity -> 170mA standard-charging-current)
connect charging cables to charging station (red = Plus, black = minus)

We will use the CC-CV charging-mode for our batteries as fast-charging is too risky
