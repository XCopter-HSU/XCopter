Flight Test 2

-----Organisation-----
The Organisation was similar to to the first flight test. For security reasons we went to a Model flying site. Againe the control was taken over by Mr. Höft because his Model flying insurance. 

-----Changes at the xCopter since the last Flight test-----
To mount the motors without the rubber vibration damper the mount points had to be modified slightly. 
The motor direction of rotation has been checked. 

-----Attempt 1----- 
Even though the conditions were bad(it was very windy this day) the xCopter  flew very well. 
The Test was a success. 

-----Conclusion----- 
In quadrocopter form the xCopter does only use about 50% of its power, so there is a lot of capacity for payload left. 
Now it’s proven that the Model is able to fly and we can start to work seriously with our own flight controller.
