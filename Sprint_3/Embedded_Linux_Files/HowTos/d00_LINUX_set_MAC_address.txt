		HowTo: Setting a static MAC-Address on DE1-SoC
	***************************************************

To connect the DE1-SoC board to the local University Network, a static MAC-Address
is needed as the board is setting new random MAC adresses with every reset.
The network config can be found in

	/etc/network/interfaces

Change the eth0 arguments from

	iface eth0 inet dhcp 

to

	iface eth0 inet static                     
        address 1.1.1.2                    
        netmask 255.255.255.0              
        network 1.1.1.255                  
        broadcast 1.1.1.255                
        gateway 1.1.1.1                    
        dns-nameservers 1.1.1.1            
        dns-search .com        
        hwaddress ether 00:01:04:1b:2C:1F (enter your OWN network information don't just copy this!)

Change the IPs to your new distributed IP address.
