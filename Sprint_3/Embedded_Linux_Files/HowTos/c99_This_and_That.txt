1. Working with CISCO-Any-Connect
   ==============================
   If you are working in your home office and you want to have
   access to HS-Ulm intranet using a windows computer together
   with Cisco-anyconnect-client software the following procedure
   might help:
   Start windows explorer (important: not mozilla firefox or
   chrome browser, it MUST be windows explorer) and call the
   following side: https://rz-asa.hs-ulm.de
   
   After successfull login the connection should be installed
   automatically.
   
2. Programming EPCQ Device
   =======================
   The EPCQ device is used to store the hardware design which
   should be automatically loaded after reset of after switching
   on the DE1-SoC board.
   The following procedure to program a successfully compiled
   QSYS/Quartus design into EPCQ device is based on the instructions
   in DE1-SoC user's manual (Chapter 8).
   
   - Assumption:
     The FPGA should be set to AS x4 mode i.e. MSEL[4..0] = “10010” 
	 to use the quad Flash as a FPGA configuration device.
	 
   - Convert .sof file to .jic file:
     - In Quartus choose: File > Convert Programming Files ...
	 - Please make the following adjustments:
	   - Programming file type:      JTAG Indirect Configuration File (.jic)
	   - Configuration device field: EPCQ256
	   - Model field:                Active Serial x4
	   - File name field:            specify an output file name
	 - In section 'Input files to convert' click on 'SOF data' and
	   then click 'Add File'
	 - Select the desired .sof file and click 'Open'
	 - Click on 'Flash Loader' and then click 'Add Device ...'
	 - Select:
	   - Device family: Cyclone V
	   - Device name:   5CSEMA5
	 - Click 'OK'
     - Back on 'Convert Programming Files' page click the 'Generate'
       button
	 
   - Write the JIC file into the EPCQ device:
     - call the Quartus II programmer (Tools > Programmer)
	 - delete all entries in programmer's main window (if any)
	 - click 'auto detect' and select '5CSEMA5' device
	 - double click the 'File' section corresponding to '5CSEMA5' 
	   device in the main window.
	   In the now appearing 'Select New Programming File' window
	   select the .jic file
	 - Don't forget to click the 'Program/Configure' box corresponding
	   to the EPCQ device before clicking the 'Start' button.
