              NIOS SBT based software development
              ===================================
                     (2015-02-18 - ms)

1. Overview
   ========
   This documents describes how software development for a
   NIOS II cpu takes place when using NIOS II SBT (software
   build tools) from Altera.
   We assume that the NIOS II SBT tools are installed on a
   Windows based computer system. Furthermore you must
   have terminal based access to the HPS which runs linux
   operating system. Furthermore 'niosboot' and/or 'niosreset'
   tools must be available on the HPS linux system.
   
   Last but not least DE1-SoC_MP-NIOS_Base_v01 SoPC should
   be installed. With this SoPC both cpu_s0 and cpu_s1 are
   in reset state.
   
2. NIOS SBT Project Setup
   ======================
   Here we could describe how to up a uC/OS-II based project
   or an Altera-HAL based project

3. Software Execution or Debugging
   ===============================
   If your software successfully compiles you may want to
   execute or debug it directly on the target. If you try to
   do this NIOS SBT will report an error. This is because
   the cpu_s0 and/or cpu_s1 are in reset state. You have to
   release the cpu(s) from reset state using niosboot or
   niosreset tool.
   With:
      ./niosboot AliveTest_for_cpu_s0.hex 0
	  or with:
	  ./niosreset OFF 0
	  cpu_s0 will be released from reset.
   With:
	  ./niosboot AliveTest_for_cpu_s1.hex 1
	  or with:
	  ./niosreset OFF 1
	  cpu_s1 will be released from reset.

   Now execution or debugging of your NIOS II software 
   should work.
