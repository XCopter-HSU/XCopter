          HowTos how to use DE1-SoC
          =========================
              (2015-05-03 - ms)

- If you want to know how to setup a linux VM which you could
  later extend by installing all the required packages and tools, 
  please have a look at:
      ==> c11_DE1-SoC_UbuntuVM.txt

- If you want to know how install all the things you need
  to build a new bootloader, a new linux image or a new SD
  card image, please have a look at:
      ==> c21_DE1-SoC_BuildrootLinux.txt

- If you want to know how to set up a terminal connection to
  DE1-SoC board you also should have a look at:
      ==> c21_DE1-SoC_BuildrootLinux.txt

- If you want to know how to develope a linux application
  for DE1-SoC board, please have a look at:
      ==> c31_HPS_appDevelopment.txt
      ==> c30_NIOS_boot_from_FPGA_sdram.txt

  (There you will find some hints how a special application,
  the niosboot tool, was developed.)

- If you have designed a nios based SoPC where the nios cpu
  should boot from onchip ram memory, here you could find
  some hints how to do it:
      ==> c40_NIOS_boot_from_onchip_ram.txt

- If you have designed a nios based SoPC where the nios cpu
  should first copy (boot) its application software from EPCQ
  non-volatile memory to sdram and then start it, here you find
  a description of the problems waiting for you:
      ==> c50_NIOS_boot_from_EPCQ_problems.txt

  An alternative and may even more flexible solution to transfer
  nios application code to sdram and to start it there is 
  given in:
      ==> c30_NIOS_boot_from_FPGA_sdram.txt

  Good Luck!!!
