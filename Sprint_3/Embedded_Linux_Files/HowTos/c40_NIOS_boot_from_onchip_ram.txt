         NIOS II Boot from on-chip memory
         ================================
                  (2015-01-20 - ms)

Start NIOS II SBT, setup and debug the software you want to install
in on-chip memory as boot software. To generate the therefore necessary
memory initialization file, perform the following steps:
1. Right-click the application project.
2. Point to 'Make targets' and click 'Build' to open the
   'Make Targets' dialog box.
3. Select 'mem_init_generate'.
4. Click 'Build'.
   The makefile generates a separate file (or files) for each memory
   device. It also generates a Quartus II IP File (.qip). The .qip
   file tells the Quartus II software where to find the initialization 
   files. The generated .qip file could be found in:
   <software-project-folder>/mem_init
5. Add the .qip file to your Quartus II project.
   In Quartus:
       Project -> Add/Remove Files in Project...
6. Recompile your Quartus II project
