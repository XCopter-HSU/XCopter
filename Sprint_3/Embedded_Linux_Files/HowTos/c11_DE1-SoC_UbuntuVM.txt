This document contains the instructions to set up a virtual
machine for VMware player, which could be used as a basis 
for installing the tools required to develop hardware 
and/or software for Altera's DE1-SoC development board.

64 version of the operating system has been chosen because this
seems to be necessary if you later want to install Altera's FPGA
tools (Quartus II, NIOS EDS, etc.). Installation has been done
on a computer running Windows 8.1 operating system and using 
VMware Player Version 6.05. (Hint: Using VMware's linux version 
of the player has caused some undefined problems during 
installation.)
   
In order to set up the VM you have to:
- download the appropriate iso image from www.ubuntu.com
  (file: ubuntu-12.04.5-desktop-amd64.iso)
- start VMware player and:
  - create a new VM -> specification of the path to the iso
    image file -> disk size adjusted to 60 GB
    Further adjustments: 2 GB RAM + 2 CPUs
	VERY IMPORTANT: in the 'Display' section you have to
	                disable 'Accelate 3D graphics'
					(otherwise Ubuntu screen will freeze
					after login)
  - VMs name: Ubuntu_1204_64bit_de1soc_v03
  - Full name: de1soc
  - User name: de1soc
    Password:  hsu

After you have started the newly generated VM you should look
for updates:
- Open a terminal window and execute:
    sudo bash    (now you are working as root)
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade

Install some additional software (not sure if we really need
all of it):
   sudo apt-get install sed wget cvs subversion git-core coreutils unzip texi2html  texinfo libsdl1.2-dev docbook-utils gawk python-pysqlite2 diffstat help2man  make gcc build-essential g++ desktop-file-utils chrpath libgl1-mesa-dev  libglu1-mesa-dev mercurial autoconf automake groff libtool xterm
   sudo apt-get install ia32-libs
   
You will also need to make /bin/sh point to bash instead of dash.
You can accomplish this by running:
   sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash
