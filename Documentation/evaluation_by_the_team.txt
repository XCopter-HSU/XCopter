Evaluation by the team

In the last three sprints we reached some important milestones like the first successful flight or the successful transmission from the RC Transmitter to the NiosII-processor. On the way to this goals, our team worked very well together and everybody solved his own tasks very carefully. So the team was able to finish a lot of small tasks in a short time. However at some tasks, we have also lost a lot of time. For example the integration of the additional USB-controller, the error analysis of the existing power supply and the installation of the WiFi-Driver on the embedded linux. Another problem was our development methodology - Scrum was a loss of time.  We decided to focus on the software development and not on scrum anymore. Thus we should be able to get more work done, in a shorter period of Time. In order to reach our goal.
